## üß™ Mid-Term Instrumentation Project

This repository contains the mid-term project for the Instrumentation course at Amirkabir University. The project explores various temperature sensors, motor control techniques, and signal processing methods using microcontrollers and simulation tools.

## üìö Topics Covered
- Temperature sensor comparison and analysis
- RPM calculation using pulse signals and timers
- H-Bridge motor control logic
- PWM signal generation and speed control
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
- Encoder signal interpretation
- Error analysis and simulation validation  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Motor Control
- H-Bridge Logic: Direction and braking control via transistor switching
- PWM Control: Speed modulation using Arduino PWM pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11)
- Enable Pin Logic: Motor activation via HIGH/LOW signals

## üìà RPM Calculation
- Using interrupts and timers to measure pulse frequency
- Formula: **RPM** = (Pulse Count √ó 60) / (Time Interval √ó Pulses per Revolution)

## Summary
This project demonstrates practical applications of instrumentation principles in embedded systems. From sensor interfacing to motor control and signal analysis, it provides a hands-on understanding of how hardware and software interact in real-world systems.
